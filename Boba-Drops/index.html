        <h2> Phylum Oomycota</h2>
        <p>The Phylum Oomycota is known as 'water molds' and are sometimes referred to as protist-like fungi. They live in water or moist and damp environments. The Phylum Oomycota's distinguishing characteristic is that they produce motile spores, which means that their sproes have the ability to swim.</p>
        <h2> Phylum Zygomycota</h2>
        <p> The Phylum Zygomycota is also known as the Common Mold, with the most common being the Black Bread Mold, Rhizopous Stolonifer. The common mold reproduces both sexually and asexually, and the sexual reproduction cycle is unique in that the fruiting body grows before fertilization occurs. Also, the Phylum Zygomycota can form a tough zygote known as a zygospore, which is able to survive harsher conditions compared to a regular zygote.</p>
